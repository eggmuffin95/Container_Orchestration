# In the file, you need provide hosts, as follows:
#
# [group]
# <hostname> ansible_host=<ip_address> (...)
# <hostname> ansible_host=<ip_address> (...)
#
# With:
#
# <hostname>: The name of the host (it has to be unique and will represent one single host)
# <ip_address>: The IP address of the host.
#

#
# Purpose-specific hosts.
#

# UCP.
#
# The first host (linux-ucp-manager-primary) will be the primary UCP node,
# every other managers will automatically become replicas.
#
# linux-ucp-manager-primary must contain one and only one host.
#
# Currently, only Linux-based machines are eligible to become the primary node.
#
# N.B. All managers are ucp-managers.

# DTR.
#
# The first host (linux-worker-dtr-primary) will be the primary DTR node, every
# nodes listed under linux-dtr-worker-replicas and windows-dtr-worker-replicas
# will be replicas.
#
# linux-dtr-primary must contain one and only one host.
#
# Currently, only Linux-based machines are eligible to become the primary node.
#
# N.B. All dtr-workers are considered workers but extra non-DTR workers can be
# added via linux-workers or windows-workers.
